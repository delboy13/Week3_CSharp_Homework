# Week3_CSharp_Homework

## What was the challenge?
The challenge was to convert a number into its equivalent word format. For example 99 becomes Ninety Nine.

## How i expected the challenge to go?

Given that i can understand most of the concepts i knew the most difficult part of this challenge would be to think about the logic behind the appraoch and what factors to consider in order to make the code work.

## What went well?
I was able to remind myself i knew more than i thought given the short study time and that i was able to understand alot of the logic, once it was in front of me.

## What didnt go as planned?
Actually implementing the code into a working programmew as difficult and i struggled at first to work out what logical approach i needed to take. With some agile teamwork i was able to eventually complete the basic working programme.

## Possible improvements?

I need to work on my logic and try not over complicate situations in order to come up with the most iable efficient formula to a problem.
